# What's included
We include every Bible translation possible and regularly check for new translations and updates to existing translations. We don't manage many translations ourselves, rather we source them from existing collections.

## Our sources
We are very thankful for those who have been making Bible translations publicly available, both those translating and those compiling existing translations:

 * [eBible](https://ebible.org/Scriptures/)
 * [Door43](https://door43.org/)
 * [The Digital Bible Library](https://thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/)

## What's not included

### Restricted translations
We are legally only able to include public domain and openly licensed translations without specific permission from Bible translation owners. However, we are actively seeking permission for such translations and you can also do so yourself (see below).

### Bad translations
We also don't include translations known to be poor quality or unfaithful to the original writings. We do include old translations (that were considered ok in their period) but provide ways of easily filtering them out.

### Apocryphal books
We only include the 66 books of the Protestant canon, so we do not include apocryphal books. We have no interest in providing access to them ourselves, but users desiring those books are welcome to fork our service which is open source.


## Accessing restricted translations
You must request permission to use restricted translations yourself directly with the owner of the translation. This is usually done by talking to them directly, making an agreement, and then gaining access via [The Digital Bible Library](https://thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/).

If you are granted access then you can easily integrate such translations with fetch(bible) by [creating your own collection](/access/collections/).


## Contributing
We greatly welcome the addition of Bible translations we don't have yet, and while we have a preference for openly licensed translations, our service also supports including ones with more limited licenses.

This is a mostly automated service that handles over a thousand Bible translations, and while we do review as much as we can, there may be some corrections needed. So please let us know if you notice anything.
