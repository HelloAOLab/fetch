# What is fetch(bible)?
It is several things...

 * __An initiative__ for making digital access to the Bible easier and more efficient
 * __A collection__ of all the Bible translations in the world that we can find
 * __A service__ for free unlimited unrestricted access to Bible content
 * __A tool__ for integrating the Bible into apps and websites with minimal effort


## What can you do with fetch(bible)?

You can integrate scripture into any website or app, whether it's quoting a single verse or creating an entire Bible app.

#### fetch(bible) stands out in the following ways:

<table>
    <tr style='background-color: transparent'>
        <td><strong>It's unrestricted</strong></td>
        <td>No signup, no request limits, no cache limits, etc *</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style='background-color: transparent'>
        <td><strong>It's easy to use</strong></td>
        <td>Get a passage in thousands of Bibles with a few lines of code</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style='background-color: transparent'>
        <td><strong>It's private</strong></td>
        <td>No tracking of you or your users</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style='background-color: transparent'>
        <td><strong>It's efficient</strong></td>
        <td>All content is distributed via a CDN making it very fast</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style='background-color: transparent'>
        <td><strong>It's open source</strong></td>
        <td>The entire service can be reviewed and improved</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<small>* Most Bible translations have licenses that you must still abide by, but fetch(bible) gets out of the way and doesn't add any restrictions of its own</small>

## Who made fetch(bible)?

[Gracious Tech](https://gracious.tech) created and maintains fetch(bible), and we believe _"All Scripture is God-breathed"_ (2 Timothy 3:16) and essential for everyone to have unrestricted access to.

Though our work was only possible thanks to the [extensive efforts of others](/legal/credits/) who have been translating, collecting, and working on tools that fetch(bible) makes use of.
