# What is fetch(bible)?
It is several things...

 * __An initiative__ for making digital access to the Bible easier and more efficient
 * __A collection__ of all the Bible translations in the world that we can find
 * __A service__ for free unlimited unrestricted access to Bible content
 * __A tool__ for integrating the Bible into apps and websites with minimal effort

## What can you do with fetch(bible)?

You can integrate scripture into any website or app, whether it's quoting a single verse or creating an entire Bible app.

#### fetch(bible) stands out in the following ways:

 * __It's easy to use__ &mdash; Get a passage in 1000+ Bibles with a few lines of code
 * __It's efficient__ &mdash; All content is distributed via a CDN making it very fast
 * __It's open source__ &mdash; Anyone can examine how it works and contribute
 * __It's private__ &mdash; No tracking of users and no registration required
 * __It's unrestricted__ &mdash; No request limits, no cache limits, can self-host

<small>* No limits from fetch(bible), but most Bible translations have terms you must still comply with</small>

## Who made fetch(bible)?

[Gracious Tech](https://gracious.tech) created and maintains fetch(bible), and we believe _"All Scripture is God-breathed"_ (2 Timothy 3:16) and essential for everyone to have unrestricted access to.

Though our work was only possible thanks to the [extensive efforts of others](/legal/credits/) who have been translating, collecting, and working on tools that fetch(bible) makes use of.
