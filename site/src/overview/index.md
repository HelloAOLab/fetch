You can integrate scripture into any website or app, whether it's quoting a single verse or creating an entire Bible app.

#### fetch(bible) stands out in the following ways:

 * __It's easy to use__ &mdash; Get a passage in 1000+ Bibles with a few lines of code

## Who made fetch(bible)?

[Gracious Tech](https://gracious.tech) created and maintains fetch(bible), and we believe _"All Scripture is God-breathed"_ (2 Timothy 3:16) and essential for everyone to have unrestricted access to.

Though our work was only possible thanks to the [extensive efforts of others](/legal/credits/) who have been translating, collecting, and working on tools that fetch(bible) makes use of.
