# Terms of service

The fetch(bible) service is provided by Gracious Tech Pty Ltd and you can use it however you like.

### Bible translations have their own licenses

You must still abide by the individual licenses of any Bible translation you use that is accessed via this service. Despite our best efforts, we do not guarantee that our services correctly detect the terms of each translation's license, so you must check them yourself before use.

### No warranty

fetch(bible) is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the service or the use or other dealings in the service.
